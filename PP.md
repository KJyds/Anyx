# Privacy Policy
Nyx is a Discord bot that plays music on a voice channel in your server. But for Qeo to perform perfectly, it needs permission to read messages, read members name, and others. 
Inviting Nyx to the server voluntarily provides Qeo with certain information. This includes server member tags, server name, and server messages.
