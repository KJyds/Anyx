# Privacy Policy

## Introduction
Anyx is a Discord bot that plays music on a voice channel in your server. This privacy policy explains how Anyx collects and uses information when you invite it to your server.

## Information We Collect
When you invite Anyx to your server, Anyx may collect the following information:
- Discord user ID
- Discord server ID
- Server chat messages (temporarily)

Anyx stores user messages temporarily for the use of the "n.snipe" command. Only trusted people with administrator permission in the server can use this command and it is not shared with anyone else, including the Anyx's owner, unless the 'n.snipe' command is used. 

## Use of Information
Anyx will use the collected information solely for the purpose of providing its services. Anyx will not sell, share or distribute this information to any third-party without the user's consent, except as required by law.

## Data Retention
Anyx retains user messages temporarily for the use of the "n.snipe" command. After this period, the messages are automatically deleted.

## Security
Anyx takes reasonable measures to protect the information it collects from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no data transmission over the internet or wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## Changes to Privacy Policy
Anyx may revise this privacy policy at any time without notice. By continuing to use Anyx after any changes to this policy, you agree to be bound by the revised policy.

## Contact Us
If you have any questions or concerns about Anyx's use of your information or Anyx's privacy policy, please contact us on the **[Anyx support server](https://discord.com/invite/MHj3BPPR5r)**.
