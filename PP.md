When you invite Anyx to your server, Anyx may collect the following information:

Anyx temporarily stores the Discord user ID and Discord server ID to function correctly as a music bot. This information is necessary for Anyx to manage the queue and play songs in the correct server.

## Data Retention
Anyx retains the Discord user ID and Discord server ID temporarily as long as it is necessary for the provision of its services. After this period, the stored information is automatically deleted.

## Security
Anyx takes reasonable measures to protect the information it collects from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no data transmission over the internet or wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
