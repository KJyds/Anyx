# Qeo Terms of Service 

Nyx is a Discord bot that plays music on a voice channel in your server. It also has other side commands and is planning on having more commands!
Unlike Qeo, Nyx barely store any information to its database.

### What about your server privacy?
By using Nyx, you agree to share users information with Qeo. In exchange, you will be able to use commands with little or no error provided by Qeo.

### What about your chat privacy?
Qeo does store chat to its client only for the "snipe" command. Other than that, there will be no other uses for it.
